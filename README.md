# SurveyMonkey Skills

> A Claude Code plugin marketplace containing job-scoped plugins for SurveyMonkey engineering workflows. Each plugin groups related skills under a single namespace so they can be installed and invoked together.

## Installation

Add the marketplace to your Claude Code settings:

```bash
claude plugin install gh-security@SurveyMonkey/skills
```

## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Namespace | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gh-security` | `/gh-security:*` | Resolve Dependabot security alerts across repositories |

## Plugin Architecture

Each plugin lives in its own directory under `plugins/` and owns a single namespace. Skills within a plugin are invoked as `/namespace:skill-name`.

```
plugins/
  gh-security/
    .claude-plugin/
      plugin.json
    skills/
      ...
```

New plugins should follow this same structure. One namespace per plugin, one concern per namespace.

## For SurveyMonkey Engineers

This repository is public so that any SurveyMonkey engineer can install these plugins without needing to be added to the GitHub org. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to propose new plugins or skills.
